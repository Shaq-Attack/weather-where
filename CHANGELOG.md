- **No personal data collection** beyond voluntary location sharing
- **Local storage only** for caching weather data
- **No user tracking** or analytics without consent
- **Transparent data usage** documented in privacy policy

### Known Limitations

#### Free Tier Constraints
- **OpenWeatherMap** free tier has rate limits (60 calls/minute, 1000 calls/day)
- **KendoReact Grid** compatibility issues led to custom table implementation
- **Wikipedia API** occasional rate limiting during high usage

#### Browser Limitations
- **Geolocation** requires HTTPS in production
- **Service Worker** features require secure context
- **Local Storage** has size limitations (~5-10MB per domain)

### Migration Notes

This is the initial release, so no migration is required. For future versions:

#### State Management
- Weather data cache format may change in future versions
- Local storage keys are versioned to prevent conflicts
- Component props maintain backward compatibility when possible

#### API Changes
- OpenWeatherMap API responses are normalized internally
- Wikipedia API changes are handled with fallback strategies
- Breaking changes will be documented in major version releases
